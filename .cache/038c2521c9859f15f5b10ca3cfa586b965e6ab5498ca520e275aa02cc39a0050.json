No other encoding is supported. As described below, some C1 control codes have both 7-bit ASCII compatible as well as 8-bit representations. As ASCII is a compatible subset of UTF-8, the 7-bit representations are preferred and processed without any special consideration.\nThe 8-bit values _are_ recognized, but only if the 8-bit value is treated as a unicode code point and encoded via a UTF-8 multi-byte sequence.\n### Printable Codepoints[¶](#printable-codepoints \"Permanent link\")\nCodepoints with value 0x20 and higher are considered to be printable and are applied to the terminal display using the following rules:\n-   Codepoints are buffered until a C0, C1 or other escape/control sequence is encountered, which triggers a flush and processing continues with the next step.\n-   The buffered codepoint sequence is split into unicode graphemes, which means that combining sequences and emoji are decoded. Processing continues for below for each individually recognized grapheme.\n-   If DEC line drawing mode is active, graphemes `j-n`, `q`, `t-x` are translated to equivalent line drawing graphemes and processing continues.\n-   If prior output/actions require it, the cursor position may be moved to a new line and the terminal display may be scrolled to make accommodate it.\n-   An appropriate number of cells, starting at the current cursor position, are allocated based on the column width of the current grapheme and are assigned to the grapheme. The current current graphics rendition state (such as colors and other presentation attributes) is also applied to those cells. If insert mode is active, those cells will be inserted at the current cursor position, otherwise they will overwrite cells at the current cursor position.\n-   The cursor position will be updated based on the column width of the grapheme.\nAfter the graphemes are applied to the terminal display, the rendering portion of WezTerm will attempt to apply your [font shaping](https://wezterm.org/config/font-shaping.html) configuration based on runs of graphemes with matching graphic attributes to determine which glyphs should be rendered from your fonts; it is at this stage that emoji and ligatures are resolved.\n### C0 Control Codes[¶](#c0-control-codes \"Permanent link\")\nCodepoints in the range `0x00-0x1F` are considered to be `C0` control codes. `C0` controls will flush any buffered printable codepoints before triggering the action described below.\n| Seq | Hex | Name | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ^@ | 0x00 | NUL | Null | Ignored |\n| ^A | 0x01 | SOH | Start of Heading | Ignored |\n| ^B | 0x02 | STX | Start of Text | Ignored |\n| ^C | 0x03 | ETX | End of Text | Ignored |\n| ^D | 0x04 | EOT | End of Transmission | Ignored |\n| ^E | 0x05 | ENQ | Enquiry | Ignored |\n| ^F | 0x06 | ACK | Acknowledge | Ignored |\n| ^G | 0x07 | BEL | Bell | Logs `Ding!

If Reverse Wraparound and dec auto wrap modes are enabled, moving left of the left margin will jump the cursor to the right margin, jumping to bottom right margin if it was at the top left. |\n| ^I | 0x09 | HT | Horizontal Tab | Move cursor right to the next tab stop |\n| ^J | 0x0A | LF | Line Feed | If cursor is at the bottom margin, scroll the region up, otherwise move cursor down 1 row |\n| ^K | 0x0B | VT | Vertical Tab | Treated as Line Feed |\n| ^L | 0x0C | FF | Form Feed | Treated as Line Feed |\n| ^M | 0x0D | CR | Carriage Return | If cursor is left of leftmost margin, move to column 0.

C1 control codes have an 8-bit representation as well as a multi-codepoint 7-bit escape sequence.\nThe 8-bit representation is recognized if the 8-bit value is treated as a unicode code point and encoded as a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence. Sending the 8-bit binary value will not be recognized as intended, as those bitsequences are passing through a UTF-8 decoder.\nThe table below lists the 7-bit `C1` sequence (which is preferred) as well as the codepoint value, along with the corresponding meaning.\nAs with `C0` control codes, `C1` controls will flush any buffered printable codepoints before triggering the action described below.\n| Seq | Codepoint | Name | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ESC D | 0x84 | IND | Index | Moves the cursor down one line in the same column. If the cursor is at the bottom margin, the page scrolls up |\n| ESC E | 0x85 | NEL | Next Line | Moves the cursor to the left margin on the next line. If the cursor is at the bottom margin, scroll the page up |\n| ESC H | 0x88 | HTS | Horizontal Tab Set | Sets a horizontal tab stop at the column where the cursor is |\n| ESC M | 0x8D | RI | Reverse Index | Move the cursor up one line. If the cursor is at the top margin, scroll the region down |\n| ESC P | 0x90 | DCS | Device Control String | Discussed below |\n| ESC \\[ | 0x9B | CSI | Control Sequence Introducer | Discussed below |\n| ESC \\\\ | 0x9C | ST | String Terminator | No direct effect; ST is used to delimit the end of OSC style escape sequences |\n### Other Escape Sequences[¶](#other-escape-sequences \"Permanent link\")\nAs these sequences start with an `ESC`, which is a `C0` control, these will flush any buffered printable codepoints before triggering the associated action.\n| Seq | Name | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ESC c | [RIS](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/RIS.html) | Reset to Initial State | Resets tab stops, margins, modes, graphic rendition, palette, activates primary screen, erases the display and moves cursor to home position |\n| ESC 7 | [DECSC](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECSC.html) | Save Cursor Position | Records cursor position |\n| ESC 8 | [DECRC](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECRC.html) | Restored Saved Cursor Position | Moves cursor to location it had when DECSC was used |\n| ESC = | [DECPAM](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECPAM.html) | Application Keypad | Enable Application Keypad Mode |\n| ESC > | [DECPNM](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECPNM.html) | Normal Keypad | Set Normal Keypad Mode |\n| ESC (0 |  | DEC Line Drawing character set | Translate characters `j-x` to line drawing glyphs |\n| ESC (B |  | US ASCII character set | Disables DEC Line Drawing character translation |\n| ESC [#8](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues/8 \"GitHub Issue: wezterm/wezterm #8\") | [DECALN](https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECALN.html) | Screen Alignment Display | Fills the display with `E` characters for diagnostic/test purposes (for vttest) |\n### CSI - Control Sequence Introducer Sequences[¶](#csi-control-sequence-introducer-sequences \"Permanent link\")\nCSI sequences begin with the `C1` `CSI` sequence, which is either the 7-bit `ESC [` sequence or the codepoint `0x9B`.\nWezTerm classifies these sequences into a number of functional families which are broken out below.\n#### Graphic Rendition (SGR)[¶](#graphic-rendition-sgr \"Permanent link\")\nSGR sequences are of the form `CSI DIGITS [; DIGITS ]+ m`. That is, any number of semicolon separated numbers, terminated by the `m` codepoint. There are a handful of slightly more modern sequences that use colon `:` codepoints to encode additional context.\nThe digits map to one of the codes in the table below, which manipulate the presentation attributes of subsequently printed characters.\nIt is valid to omit the code number; for example `CSI m` is equivalent to `CSI 0 m` which resets the presentation attributes.\n| Code | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | Reset | Reset to default foreground/background colors, reset all presentation attributes, clear any explicit hyperlinks |\n| 1 | IntensityBold | Set the intensity level to Bold. This causes subsequent text to be rendered in a bold font variant and, if the foreground color is set to a palette index in the 0-7 range, effectively shifts it to the brighter value in the 8-15 range |\n| 2 | IntensityDim | Set the intensity level to Dim or Half-Bright. This causes text to be rendered in a lighter weight font variant |\n| 3 | ItalicOn | Sets the italic attribute on the text, causing an italic font variant to be selected |\n| 4 | UnderlineOn | Text

will be rendered with a dashed underline |\n| 5 | BlinkOn | Indicates that the text should blink <150 times per minute |\n| 6 | RapidBlinkOn | Indicates that the text should blink >150 times per minute |\n| 7 | InverseOn | Causes the foreground and background colors to be swapped |\n| 8 | InvisibleOn | Marks text as invisible. |\n| 9 | StrikeThroughOn | Text will be rendered with a single line struck through the middle |\n| 21 | UnderlineDouble | Text will be rendered with double underline |\n| 22 | NormalIntensity | Cancels the effect of IntensityBold and IntensityDim, returning the text to normal intensity |\n| 23 | ItalicOff | Cancels the effect of ItalicOn |\n| 24 | UnderlineOff | Text will have no underline |\n| 25 | BlinkOff | Cancels the effect of BlinkOn and RapidBlinkOn |\n| 27 | InverseOff | Cancels the effect of InverseOn |\n| 28 | InvisibleOff | cancels the effect of InvisibleOn |\n| 29 | StrikeThroughOff | Cancels the effect of StrikeThroughOn |\n| 30 |

the user's configured default text color |\n| 40 | BackgroundBlack | Sets the background color to ANSI Black, which is palette index 0 |\n| 41 | BackgroundRed | Sets the background color to ANSI Red, which is palette index 1 |\n| 42 | BackgroundGreen | Sets the background color to ANSI Green, which is palette index 2 |\n| 43 | BackgroundYellow | Sets the background color to ANSI Yellow, which is

49 | BackgroundDefault | Sets the background color to the user's configured default background color |\n| 53 | OverlineOn | Renders text with a single overline/overbar |\n| 55 | OverlineOff | Cancels OverlineOn |\n| 59 | UnderlineColorDefault | Resets the underline color to default, which is to match the foreground color |\n| 73 | VerticalAlignSuperScript | Adjusts the baseline of the text so that it renders as superscript (_Since: Version 20221119-145034-49b9839f_) |\n| 74 | VerticalAlignSubScript | Adjusts the baseline of the text so that it renders as subscript (_Since: Version

foreground color to Bright Blue, which is palette index 12 |\n| 95 | ForegroundBrightMagenta | Sets the foreground color to Bright Magenta, which is palette index 13 |\n| 96 | ForegroundBrightCyan | Sets the foreground color to Bright Cyan, which is palette index 14 |\n| 97 | ForegroundBrightWhite | Sets the foreground color to Bright White, which is palette index 15 |\n| 100 |

index 13 |\n| 106 | BackgroundBrightCyan | Sets the background color to Bright Cyan, which is palette index 14 |\n| 107 | BackgroundBrightWhite | Sets the background color to Bright White, which is palette index 15 |\nThere are a handful of additional SGR codes that allow setting extended colors; unlike the codes above, which are activated by a single numeric parameter out of SGR sequence, these the extended color codes require multiple parameters. The canonical representation of these sequences is to have the multiple parameters be separated by colons (`:`), but for compatibility reasons WezTerm also accepts an ambiguous semicolon (`;`) separated variation. The colon form is unambiguous and should be preferred; the semicolon form should not be used by new applications and is not documented here in the interest of avoiding accidental new implementations.\n##### CSI 38:5 - foreground color palette index[¶](#csi-385-foreground-color-palette-index \"Permanent link\")\nThis sequence will set the _foreground color_ to the specified palette INDEX, which can be a decimal number in the range `0-255`.\n`[](#__codelineno-0-1)CSI 38 : 5 : INDEX m`\n##### CSI 48:5 - background color palette index[¶](#csi-485-background-color-palette-index \"Permanent link\")\nThis sequence will set the _background color_ to the specified palette INDEX, which can be a decimal number in the range `0-255`.\n`[](#__codelineno-1-1)CSI 48 : 5 : INDEX m`\n##### CSI 58:5 - underline color palette index[¶](#csi-585-underline-color-palette-index \"Permanent link\")\nThis sequence will set the _underline color_ to the specified palette INDEX, which can be a decimal number in the range `0-255`.\n`[](#__codelineno-2-1)CSI 58 : 5 : INDEX m`\n##### CSI 38:2 - foreground color: RGB[¶](#csi-382-foreground-color-rgb \"Permanent link\")\nThis sequence will set the _foreground color_ to an arbitrary color in RGB colorspace.
